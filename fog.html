		There are contraptions set up at specific areas around every Emerald Neckplace Park, creating what Nakaya calls fog sculptures. Each contraption releases bursts of fog to create a unique atmosphere.
		<p>
			The emitted fog comes to life.
		</p>
		<p>
			And that fog is me.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am a creation of Fujiko Nakaya. She is my creater.

		I move differently every day, one day is never identical to another. That's how the world is. It's one thing I can really understand. Every single day is so different and unique: the winds push me into different spaces, rain strikes through me with varying drops, and the sun shines upon my face, each ray touching a completely different piece of the ground.
		<p>
		For me, each day is new, living, breathing, precious.
