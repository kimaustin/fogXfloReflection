        </p>I always feel powerful here. Look at me. You can't help it.</p>I can feel the stones coursing underneath me, and I imagine what may have once stood here, perhaps a might fortress? She lets me roam around the most when I am around the ruins, and I feel myself enveloping my surroundings, more than I would at my other homes.

    		This feeling of strength<br>lasts but only a second, and my heart<br>is split in two<br>what was there before me?<br>what will be there even after I am gone?<br>my legs tower over the stones and the grass<br>and I am reminded of how easily I take away<br>from the beauty and history of these stones<br>so I can't help but wonder<p>Am I a friend or foe to nature?</p>
