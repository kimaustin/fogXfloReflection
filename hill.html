        I want to fit in. I want be one with humans, coexisting on stable lands, moving around the earth... but I know I belong to Emerald Necklace and Her. 
          <p>As my legs wrap around some of the trees here, I know they aren't fond of my attachments. Still, our times together are always enjoyable.

        Compared to anywhere else, I am the most at peace on the hill. I find it a space that is most serene, most comforting and loving. Most days, the trees are quietly chattering, and I always enjoy joining in on their conversation.

        One of my favorite things about the hill is it's peak. It is especially pleasant whenever someone is sitting at the top, looking down, where I am at the forefront of their view. 
          <p>Nothing feels better than to admired in conjunction with the land under me.
