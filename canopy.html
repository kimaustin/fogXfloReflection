        I'm the closest to humans in the canopy. Those kids are playing soccer on the field, that man is taking his morning run, and cars are zipping by across the ripples of the peaceful pond. So much goes on around me. So many things are alive around me.

        But at the same time, I am even more distant from human life than before. I see more and more people pass by me. More and more people walking by doing their own thing, ignoring me, already becoming numb to my presence.

       Some days I barely see over the heights of the trees. Other days I can almost touch the roads... though She made sure that would never happen. Sometimes I forget how dangerous I can be.  
        <p>
          She set me free, letting me roam around in the real world, but am I really free? Sure, I am able to extend myself to wherever the winds take me, but eventually, I rise and become one with the sky. It seems that I always end up in the sky... that part of my day never changes.

          Why can't I stay?
